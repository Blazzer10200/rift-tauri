## v0.53.0 — Instant first reply

> The very first message in a new chat used to be the slowest one — every fresh chat paid the full cold start (loading your Claude setup, hooks, and config) before a single word appeared, often 9–10 seconds of staring at nothing. Now Rift warms a process up *before* you hit send, so the first reply starts as fast as every reply after it.

### Speed
- **The first turn is now warm too.** When you open a fresh chat with a folder set, Rift quietly spins up a ready Claude process in the background and parks it. The moment you send, that process is adopted instantly — the cold-start cost (re-loading your global `~/.claude` config, hooks, and tools) is already paid, so the reply begins right away instead of after a long pause. If you change the model or settings before sending, the spare is discarded and you get a normal cold start — never worse than before. It also steps aside automatically when you're near a usage limit, so it never spends your budget on a reply you didn't ask for.
- **More chats stay warm at once.** The warm-process pool grew from 3 to 6 and the "you're still active" window widened, so juggling several chats or pausing to read a long answer no longer drops you back to a cold start on your next message.

### Reliability
- **Fixed a process leak in the warm pool.** When a warm process was retired — because you changed the model, it went idle, or the app updated — the underlying Claude process could survive in the background instead of shutting down, slowly accumulating until you restarted Rift. All three retirement paths now shut the process down for real.

## Earlier (full detail via `git log -- docs/CHANGELOG.md`)

- **v0.52.1** — A faster, sharper assistant: stopped a silent 6–8s "thinking" pause on every reply (thinking now defaults off, with a clear "Thinking…" label when it's on), made the assistant batch independent tool calls in parallel instead of one-at-a-time, tightened edits to match your codebase and stay in scope, and silenced repetitive update-check error spam.

- **v0.52.0** — Voice mode overhaul: a real mic meter driven by your actual voice level (Web Speech + on-device Whisper), **Ctrl+D** to dictate (tap to toggle or hold for push-to-talk), a "stopping soon" countdown for auto-stop-on-silence, and transcript cleanup moved onto a current model.

- **v0.51.3** — Haiku 4.5 removed from the model picker (Anthropic pulled it); anything pinned to Haiku falls back to Sonnet, older Haiku chats still render. Reversible kill-switch, same as Fable.
- **v0.51.2** — A correctness batch from a three-pass audit: background-task promises that never resolved, the plan/Tasks card surviving a reload, the model-picker flyout keyboard behavior, prompt-enhance timeouts, cross-chat state leaks, clean stop-mid-turn records, and a pile of smaller reactivity fixes.
- **v0.51.1** — Sub-agent panel overhaul: a live "now doing" line per helper agent, a recent-steps trail, an alive header, and no more overlapping the chat.

- **v0.51.0** — A faster assistant + a redesigned picker: fixed the "everything is slow" regression (a flipped permission default was parking every tool on an approval the UI never showed), turned extended thinking off by default, rebuilt the model + effort picker in Rift's design language (identity icons, a "More models" flyout, an honest Low→X-High effort dial), and revived the Tasks/Plan panel after a CLI tool-rename broke its allow-list.

- **v0.50.0** — The biggest release in a while: the Workspace page became a real bento **dashboard** (your activity inline + a "What's new in AI" feed + a richer Projects panel), the **AI Health** tab grew into a genuine diagnostic (plain-English health score + warm-aware root-cause latency), and a broad **cross-machine compatibility** pass (safer first-run default, corporate-TLS trust, domain/locked-down machines, smaller screens, honest errors) lets Rift run cleanly on other people's Windows PCs.

- **v0.36.2** — Fable 5 is back: Anthropic's limited-run Fable 5 model returned, so it's once more an option in the model picker with its full 1M-token context and effort range.

- **v0.36.1** — The Claude CLI update actually updates now: clicking "Update" on the CLI bar would spin and then snap right back to the same prompt without moving the version (a running background Claude process held the CLI's file locked on Windows, and the bar read the stale version). Now Rift shuts those processes down before updating and re-checks right after. Plus quieter internals — bounded background-agent history and a handful of small correctness fixes.

- **v0.36.0** — One place for everything that happens: a real **notification center** (a bell in the toolbar with history grouped by when, persisting across restarts), updates moved into an always-visible top bar instead of the corner, redesigned toasts, a calmer chat surface (collapsing long code blocks, stream spacing polish), and a fix for a burst of internal errors on startup.

- **v0.35.0** — A reliability pass on the quiet edges: a stuck turn surfaces instead of hanging forever (dead-pipe detection + retry on a fresh process), the auto-updater recovers from a poisoned internal lock, CLI-update checks read as "Checking…" instead of a stale result, and git-timeout kills are scoped to git.

- **v0.31.2–v0.34.0** — Windows that stay in sync (multi-window, one per monitor; conversation list synced across all), **Use my full Claude Code config** (inherit your global `~/.claude` setup), a ground-up Workspace redesign + adopt-an-existing-folder, and a project editor that tells you what's wrong (live glob validation, plain-English errors).

- **v0.27.0–v0.31.1** — Projects + Workspace era: named folder aliases with include/exclude scoping + a merged **Workspace** home, glob matching that actually works (`**` spans folders), AI Health (your own Claude coaches your plan), a 145-finding hardening pass, accessibility polish, the activity stats panel, and finished split-view.

- **v0.20.7–v0.26.3** — Foundation era (detail via `git log`): full redesign port (all 7 surfaces to spec) + stream design language, the warm-CLI process (first reply ~1400ms → ~5ms after, 30-min idle survival, transparent respawn), honest API-stall watchdog, interactive `ask_user` cards, context ring, sub-agent activity dock, latency auto-scale, per-project chat scoping.
